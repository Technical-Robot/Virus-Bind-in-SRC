Project for RKP-786 by @Technical_Robot. This is a proof of concept and not intended for actual use. 

This app is a Mihrk-Hack for rooted and non rooted Android devices that logs view click, view focus, and text change events and sends the data to a remote server. It makes use of an Android accessibility service to read and extract info across apps. Root access is used to automatically enable the service without the user's knowledge, but the Mihrk-Hack will still work on unrooted devices if the user manually enables the accessibility service in the settings. 

To install and run: Download the source and open the SRC-MiHRK folder as a project in Android Studio. Then run the app on an emulator or a connected device...
