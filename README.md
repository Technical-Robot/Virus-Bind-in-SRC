Project for RKP-786 by @Technical_Robot.
This is a proof of concept and not intended for actual use. 

This app is a Mihrk-Hack for rooted and non rooted
Android devicesthat logs view click, view focus,
and text change events and sends the data to a
remote server. It makes use of an Android 
accessibility service to read and extract 
info across apps. Root access is used to
automatically enable the service without the user's
knowledge, but the Mihrk-Hack will still work 
on unrooted devices if the user manually enables the
accessibility service in the settings. 

To install and run: Download the source
and open the SRC-MiHRK folder as a project
in Android Studio. Then run the app on an
emulator or a connected device...
